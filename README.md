# ImageEnhancement
Various models for handling underexposure, overexposure, super-resolution, shadow removal, etc.

This repo serves as implementations of various image enhancement models meant to
run on Herbie, an autonomous robot project advised by Dr. Seng within Cal Poly's
CSC/CPE Department.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6
- TensorFlow
- Pillow
